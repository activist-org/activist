# Environment setup [`⇧`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary>Suggested IDE setup</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> Install the following extensions:
>
> - [batisteo.vscode-django](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=batisteo.vscode-django)
> - [bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

> - [Vue.volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
>
> WebStorm
>
> - Check out the [Vue.js development docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/vue-js.html)
> - Make sure a [local Node.js interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter) is configured in your project
> - Make sure the [Vue.js plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/vuejs) and [JavaScript Debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-javascript-debugger.html) are enabled in the plugins page of the settings
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. To setup your development environment, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Docker, activist recommends installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Docker Desktop comes with many Docker tools and a straightforward user interface.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/activist.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 🔑
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/activist.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd activist
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/activist-org/activist.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (activist repository)

4. Create a virtual environment for the backend, activate it and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Unix or MacOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # After activating venv:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Start your docker images with the following:

    ```bash
    # --build only necessary with new dependencies or backend model changes
    docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build

    # And to stop the containers when you're done working:
    # docker compose --env-file .env.dev down
    ```

   Sometimes changes to the database can cause the database population to fail in your environment. If this happens, you can destroy the deployment and rebuild it:

    ```bash
    # Destroy your current docker-compose deployment:
    docker-compose rm -f -v --env-file .env.dev
    ```

6. You can then visit <http://localhost:3000> to see the development frontend build once the container is up and running. From there click `View organizations` or `View events` to explore the platform.

7. To view the backend admin UI and Swagger UI, visit <http://localhost:8000/admin> and <http://localhost:8000/v1/schema/swagger-ui/> respectively.

8. If you'd like to sign in to the frontend via <http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-in> or the Django admin panel via <http://localhost:8000/admin>, then you can use the fixtures `admin` user with the password `admin`.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Development room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!CRgLpGeOBNwxYCtqmK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=acter.global&via=chat.0x7cd.xyz) if you're having problems getting your environment setup! If you're having issues with Docker and just want to get the frontend or backend up and running, please see [the section on this in the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#using-yarn-or-python).

9. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

    ```bash
    # In the project root:
    pre-commit install

    # Then test the pre-commit hooks to see how it works:
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements-dev.txt](backend/requirements-dev.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```

<a id="platform-features"></a>

# Platform features [`⇧`](#contents)

The [project board](https://github.com/orgs/activist-org/projects/1) is where we organize our work and plan out what's next. The following sections give a general overview of the various planned features of [activist.org](https://activist.org).

### Organizations profiles [`⇧`](#contents)

> Easy-to-use microsites for organizations of all sizes with multiple subpages.

Describe your organization’s aims and structure as well as answer frequently asked questions. Explain how your groups collaborate and safely onboard new people to the team.

### Events [`⇧`](#contents)

> Collaborative event pages made for activists and their needs.

Organizations can create flexible event pages for different formats of events. There are two types of events:

- **Learn**: seminars, meetings, panel discussions
- **Action**: protests, volunteering, canvassing

Other event features include:

- A feed will allow organizers to share information in real time with participants
- Organizations can create event templates and share them with allies
- Event pages can be transformed into flyers or posters and linked to via QR codes
- Legal notes can be added to warn participants of the risks involved

### Resources [`⇧`](#contents)

> A simple link hub for organizations.

Organizations can keep important links (chats, articles, pads, etc.) in one place and are split into working groups to present structure. Private by default, resources can also be made public to share information and best practices.

### Onboarding [`⇧`](#contents)

> Safe methods to onboard new members.

We are working on a conversational onboarding interface based on the [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/) that operates across messengers without compromising data sovereignty for organizations or individuals. Organizations will also have the option to include their existing processes if preferred.

### Search [`⇧`](#contents)

> Easily find, filter and share.

Display search results in list, map and calendar views. Users can also save searches for later or set up notifications for newly published events, resources, and discussions.

### Discussions [`⇧`](#contents)

> Dedicated forums for organizations and their events.

Discussions will also allow organizations, groups and events to send notifications to supporters. Included features for democratic decision making will further enable asynchronous planning.

### Tasks [`⇧`](#contents)

> Kanban boards for organizing the work to be done.

Users will be able to attach kanban boards to every organization, group and event. This will allow those involved to easily plan and keep an overview of progress while templates guide organizers with best practices from our community.

### Affiliates [`⇧`](#contents)

> Relationships between organizations, people and events.

Organizations and users can give support to each other as well as events:

- **Supporter**: a one-way relationship of support
- **Ally**: a relationship of mutual support

Relationships between organizations will help users find similar organizations or easily connect with actions when they’re in a new place. Affiliations will also determine notifications and access to restricted content.

### Votes [`⇧`](#contents)

> Linking events and organizations to decision making.

Users will be able to subscribe for updates on events and organizations that work in relation to legislation and elections. The plan for this feature is that it will be based on data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), with open data generating the vote pages that our community then maintains.

<a id="securely-hosted"></a>

# Securely hosted [`⇧`](#contents)

We are hosting our data in Iceland with a reputable hosting provider that is trusted by whistleblowers, activists and investigative journalists: [FlokiNET](https://flokinet.is/).

Iceland is a strong supporter for net neutrality with strict privacy protection laws and freedom of the press. All these factors have contributed to making Iceland a preferred destination for data centers.

> You can learn more about FlokiNET on [their blog](https://blog.flokinet.is).

<a id="community-governance"></a>

# Community governance [`⇧`](#contents)

We not only value, but need open discourse. Our initial feature set for the MVP and future releases was developed together with our growing community of activists.

Our aim is to secure a progressive community by design while putting platform health before platform growth. Only organizations that are already on activist will be able to vouch for new organizations that apply to join. Together with experienced activists we are selecting an initial group of organizations that have a proven track record of inclusivity and elevating underrepresented groups.

We are still developing our operating principles and will always update them based on community decisions. Questions around flagging, banning, guidelines and rules will always be answered collectively.

<a id="localization"></a>

# Localization [`⇧`](#contents)

<a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/activist/activist"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activist-org/Organization/main/resources/images/logos/WeblateLogo.png" height="100" alt="Visit Weblate project" align="right"></a>

We need to break down language barriers in order to mobilize larger and more diverse coalitions. Translation requests will be available for several assets on the platform - organization profiles, events and resources - and we are growing our network of volunteer contributors to facilitate this.

> [!NOTE]
> Want to join our translators working group? Please join us in the [localization project on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/activist/activist) and the [Localization channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!DzbdYyfhjinQBWXgQe:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) to get involved!

Localization of activist is done via [Weblate](https://weblate.org). Please see the [localization guide](LOCALIZATION.md) for information on how to get started!
