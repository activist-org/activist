### Open-source, nonprofit activism platform

[**activist.org**](https://activist.org) is a network for political action that allows people to coordinate and collaborate on the issues that matter most to them. The current goal is the creation of a central platform to discover activist organizations and their events.

> **Note**: The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [supported by](#supported-by) also being good resources for learning more about activist.

# Platform Overview [`‚áß`](#contents)

The following sections give a general overview of the various features of [activist.org](https://activist.org).

## Organizations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist is first and foremost about organizations, with the design of the platform being tailored to their needs. The main function of organizations on activist is organizing and hosting [events](#events), but future features aim to help them achieve their goals and scale more effectively.

Organizations will eventually have the following features:

### Applying to join

All organizations have to apply to join activist. The application process is the way that the community transparently expands, with the support from organizations already on the platform serving to verify those who want to join. Interactions on the platform will also in some cases be limited to members of organizations. In this way we create important links of trust from organizations to other organizations and each organization to its individual members.

### Working Groups

Working groups will allow organizations to organize themselves into smaller teams for specific purposes.

### Communications

Organizations will be able to send out communications to their members (announcements) and supporters (statements).

### Tasks

Tasks are all the things that organizations need to do, which will be able to be organized in lists and kanban boards.

<a id="events"></a>

## Events [`‚áß`](#contents)

Events are where things happen on activist. They are organized by [movements](#movements), [types](#types) and [formats](#formats): the first being the focus of the event; the second being the kind of participation that people attending should expect; and the third being the specific kind of activity happening (see below).

<a id="movements"></a>

### Movements

activist will eventually include a broad selection of movements. From the start the platform will focus on a select few: `Environment`, `Housing` and `Refugees and Migration`. Further movements will be added later as interest from organizations and the community grows. The following are the working movements that activist could include:

|                      |                             |                            |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Environment          | Housing                     | Refugees and Migration     |
| LGTBQIA+             | Racial Justice              | Women's Rights             |
| Children's Rights    | Elder Rights                | Education                  |
| Health and Wellbeing | Animal Rights               | Democracy                  |
| Labor Rights         | Technology and Privacy      | Peace and Resolution       |
| Nutrition            | Accessibility and Inclusion | Institutional Transparency |
| Infrastructure       | Freedom of Expression       | Emergency Relief           |

<br/>
Beyond clustering by movements, tags will also be used to draw community attention to more specific issues.

<a id="types"></a>

### Types

`Act` and `Learn` are the two types of an event on activist, with coloration being used to easily delineate the level of participation for a particular event (üî¥ red is for act and üîµ blue is for learn).

<a id="formats"></a>

### Formats

Types are further broken down into specific formats. The available formats currently include:

- Act: protests, volunteering, organizing, fundraising
- Learn: seminars, webinars, meetings, panel discussions

Formats are not required for events like movements and types, but add an optional granularity to help people find what they're looking for.

## Resources [`‚áß`](#contents)

Resources at the start will aggregate links to files that organizations want to present to their members and the general public (if made open). Later the goal is to allow for the creation of unique hosted resources such as maps that indicate areas of interest, findings from researchers, news articles and any other kind of information that they would like to share.

## Activists [`‚áß`](#contents)

Activists, user accounts, will not be included in the MVP beyond what's needed for organization management. The main goal at the start is to derive technical specifications that assure that privacy at the highest level can be provided to those users who want it, while at the same time balancing features needed by the community. Activism is dangerous work for many and the platform will respect the needs of those who need anonymity in their work and still want to participate.

## Affiliations [`‚áß`](#contents)

activist will have various kinds of relationships between organizations and activists that are collectively known as affiliations. The possible affiliations include:

- Supporter: an organization or activist that supports another ‚û°Ô∏è
- Ally: the relationship of mutual support ‚ÜîÔ∏è

What kind of affiliate an organization or activist is will determine their notifications and degrees of access to private content.

## Votes [`‚áß`](#contents)

Another forthcoming feature, the votes section would allow events to be made in relation to elections and legislation. This would allow users to filter by votes to find events that have an impact on the legislative process. Generally the idea is that [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) would be used as a source for votes in the various regions in which activist operates.
