# Issues and projects [`⇧`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for activist](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). activist also organizes related issues into [projects](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/projects).

Be sure to check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors.

# Bug reports [`⇧`](#contents)

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful — thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

Bug reports are marked with the [`bug`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) label in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues).

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

<a name="feature-requests"></a>

# Feature requests [`⇧`](#contents)

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the [`feature`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature) label in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues).

<a name="pull-requests"></a>

# Pull requests [`⇧`](#contents)

Good pull requests — patches, improvements and new features — are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and should follow the coding indentation and style standards (contact us if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upsteam-owner>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

The [designs for activist](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231) are made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

Design related issues are marked with the [`design`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) label.

Note that the linked Figma file above is the [public facing designs](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231). Those interested in improving them or contributing designs for new features are invited to contact the team on GitHub and via other means. We'd love to see a sample of your work, and if everything looks good we'll schedule a time to get connected!

All branding elements such as logos, icons, colors and fonts should follow those that are set out in [activist-org/Organization](https://github.com/activist-org/Organization). As the project is fully open source, these elements are also open for discussion. Your efforts in making activist products professional with a distinct and cohesive identity are much appreciated.
