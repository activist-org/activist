[Weblate](https://weblate.org) localization is as easy as making an account and jumping into the activist project!

1. First [register at Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/) (you can also authenticate with GitHub or other accounts)

   - We suggest that you do link your GitHub account so you get credit for the localization commits!

2. Navigate to the activist project at [weblate.org/projects/activist/activist](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/activist/activist)

3. Click on a language you want to start translating

4. You can browse the available strings or start translating directly

   - When translating a word, be sure to check the glossary context if you're not sure what the string's use is

   - You can also make use of Automatic suggestions to see machine translations if you need help

5. Hit `Save and continue` when you're ready to move to the next string

6. Maintainers will open up pull requests from [Weblate](https://weblate.org) to the activist repo to bring in the new strings

   - Changes are also automatically sent every 24 hours

Thanks so much for your interest in supporting activist's localization!
