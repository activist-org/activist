            We're a Berlin-based team with a growing global network of
            affiliates and partners. Our goal is to create and maintain a
            platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism,
            learn from experienced organizers as well as replicate proven and
            novel strategies and tactics for social and ecological change.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're building a free, open-source and privacy-focused technical
            infrastructure that can rival with the commercial campaigning tools
            that are often inaccessible — financially and/or technically — to
            small progressive organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to end their dependance on Big Tech infrastructure and put
            tools of social action into the hands of everyone willing to work
            towards a more equitable society. Well-executed campaign tactics
            should not be the exception for well-funded, tech-savvy activists,
            but a tool for all participants in social movements.
          </p>
          <p>
            That also means building a user experience that is easy and fun to
            use while establishing security best-practices from the very
            beginning. From signup to regularly organizing events. Imagine every
            person new to activism showing up well-prepared to their first
            meeting — guided by the knowledge and tools of veteran organizers —
            and immediately being able to contribute a meaningful cause.
