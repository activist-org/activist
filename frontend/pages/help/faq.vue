            Q: What does the activist "a" mean?
          </p>
          <p class="sm:text-lg">
            The center of the letter represents an arrow that points left-center
            from the top. This symbolizes our community and direction: that we
            want to work with the left and center of the political spectrum and
            value a democratic movement of power down to the people. Other
            meanings are welcome :D
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold responsive-text-1">
            Q: How does activist plan to prevent abuse?
          </p>
          <p class="sm:text-lg">
            The big focus of activist is organizations. We will start with a
            select few organizations based in Berlin where the core team is
            located, with further organizations being added through applications
            that need approval from the community. Users themselves will have a
            limited scope of interaction if they're not in an organization. When
            we get to a point where public discussions are happening, a user
            will only be able to participate if they're a member of an
            organization.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold responsive-text-1">Q: What about privacy?</p>
          <p class="sm:text-lg">
            Thank you for asking! Privacy is a major concern for the team as we
            understand that activism can be very dangerous. Working in the open
            allows our code to be checked for vulnerabilities, and we welcome
            feedback in this regard. Between functionality and privacy we will
            always choose the latter. This means that some features of activist
            will take longer to make sure that they're created in a way that
            keeps people safe.
