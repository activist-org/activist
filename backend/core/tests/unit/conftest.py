def turn_off_throttling(settings, request: pytest.FixtureRequest):
    """
    Automatically disables API throttling for all tests unless the test is marked with 'enable_throttling'.

    This fixture modifies the Django REST Framework settings to set throttle rates for both anonymous and authenticated users to None.
    This effectively turns off request throttling during test execution.
    If the test is explicitly marked with 'enable_throttling', this fixture does not alter the throttling settings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings : django.conf.settings
        The Django settings fixture, used to modify REST framework configuration.

    request : pytest.FixtureRequest)
        Provides information about the requesting test function, including markers.

    Notes
    -----
    To enable throttling for a specific test, mark it with @pytest.mark.enable_throttling.
