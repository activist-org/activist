# Fundraising 2025

**activist.org** is — and always has been — a global community effort.&#x20;

Over 200 people have already contributed their skills, time, and care.&#x20;

But the world is unraveling even faster than we imagined when we began.

We’re not building another platform — we’re building the foundations for an **ecology of resistance**.&#x20;

A space where new and old unions of labour, tenants, and collectives can organize without being locked into extractive systems.&#x20;

An infrastructure that empowers them to **migrate to safety** and **own their sovereign tech**.

Where big tech nudges users to hand over more and more data, we nudge in the opposite direction — toward an **escape** from technofeudal platforms. Toward autonomy, federation, and community control.

We believe this project can become self-sustaining and even fund its own growth — if we continue acting as a node where new constellations of people-power take shape.

But to get there faster — to build legal resilience, grow training capacity, and accelerate development — **we need backers who are ready to take a stand.**
