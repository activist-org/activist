# Finances

Your financial support will help us launch our platform faster and keep it free for its community.

By donating, you make it possible for us to sustain our infrastructure, continually develop tools that empower activists worldwide and fairly compensate contributors, who can not donate their labour.

### Why We Need Your Support

Running a platform like ours requires resources. Donations allow us to cover essential costs, like servers and tools, and speed up development. Just as importantly, your support enables us to fairly compensate contributors who bring diverse perspectives and expertise to our platform—individuals who might not be able to participate without financial support.

### Transparency and Accountability

We are committed to managing our finances transparently. All incoming funds and expenditures are openly tracked, giving our supporters full visibility into how their contributions are used. When direct payouts aren’t possible, we find alternative ways to support contributors, such as providing necessary equipment or tools.&#x20;
