Their use is restricted and protected under intellectual property law. While the software we create is available under a free and open-source software license, the copyright license does not include an implied right or license to use our trademarks.

You agree to defend and indemnify Activist.org from and against any and all claims and losses brought by a third party in connection with your use of the Activist.org trademarks.
