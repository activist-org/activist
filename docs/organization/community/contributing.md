# Contributing

We use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) for our internal communication. You're more than welcome to [join us in our public chat rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#activist\_community:matrix.org) to share ideas, ask questions or just say hi to the team :)

Please see the [contribution guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [style guide](../../../STYLEGUIDE.md) if you are interested in contributing. Work that is in progress or could be implemented is tracked in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) and [projects](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/projects).

{% hint style="info" %}
Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean that the team isn't interested in your contribution!&#x20;

Feel free to write [in the issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Also check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors. For those new to coding or our tech stack, we've collected [links to helpful documentation pages](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#learning-the-tech) in the [contribution guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
{% endhint %}

We would be happy to discuss granting you further rights as a contributor after your first pull requests, with a maintainer role being possible after continued interest in the project.&#x20;

activist seeks to be an inclusive, diverse and supportive organization.&#x20;
