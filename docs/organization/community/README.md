# Community

Our goal is to create and maintain a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism, learn from experienced organizers as well as replicate proven and novel strategies and tactics for social and ecological change.

We're building a free, open-source and privacy-focused technical infrastructure that can rival with the commercial campaigning tools that are often inaccessible — financially and/or technically — to small progressive organizations.

We want to end their dependance on Big Tech infrastructure and put the right digital tools into the hands of everyone willing to work towards a more equitable society. Well-executed campaign tactics should not be the exception for well-funded, tech-savvy activists, but accessible and reproducible for all participants in social movements.

That also means building a user experience that is easy and fun to use while establishing security best-practices from the very beginning. From signup to regularly organizing events. Imagine every person new to activism showing up well-prepared to their first meeting — guided by the knowledge and tools of veteran organizers — and immediately being able to contribute to a meaningful cause.
