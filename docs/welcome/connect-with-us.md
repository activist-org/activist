# Connect with us

The activist community uses [Matrix chat rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#activist\_community:matrix.org) for communication. It'd be great to have you join! If you're new to Matrix, we'd suggest [Element](https://element.io/) for your client. The community including the development team would be happy to connect with you!

Feature requests should also be sent via our open-source codebase [on GitHub](https://github.com/activist-org/activist). Go to [the Issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) and select "New issue" to get started.

For other inquiries simply email us at [team@activist.org](mailto:team@activist.org).&#x20;

In all communication, we ask that you respect our [community code of conduct](../../.github/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md).
