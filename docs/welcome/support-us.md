# Support us

We are building a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action. We want to enable activists to learn proven and novel strategies from each other for social and ecological change. Free, open-source, privacy-focused and governed by our community.

But we need your help to make this vision a reality.

There are several ways you can contribute: by sharing your **skills**, amplifying our **reach** or supporting us **financially**. Please consider how you might support us in one or more of these areas.

***

### Skills

Join us in building and enhancing the platform that empowers activists worldwide. Whether you're a coder, translator, campaign strategist, artist, or legal consultant, your skills can make a significant impact.

Find the group that matches your interest and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

We'd be happy to acknowledge your efforts on our [supporters page](https://activist.org/de/supporters).

### Reach

Help us amplify our message and reach a broader audience. If you have an audience — be it through social media, journalism, or other platforms — you can play a crucial role in spreading the word about our platform.

* **Connect with Us on Social Media**: Share our content and updates to increase our visibility.
* **Collaborate on Campaigns**: Partner with us to create impactful campaigns that resonate with your audience. We'd love to hear your ideas on how we can work together.&#x20;

### Financial support

Our goal as a community is to keep the platform free and inclusive for all of our network of organizations and users. We believe that contributing is a privilege not everyone can afford — many people must devote most of their time to earning a living and can't volunteer their work for free. By donating, you enable us to compensate these contributors fairly and cover our recurring costs like infrastructure and tools.

    * Donate to our fiscal host **Änderwerk** and receive a donation receipt (in Germany)\
