Organizations and users can give support to each other as well as events:

* **Supporter**: a one-way relationship of support
* **Ally**: a relationship of mutual support

Relationships between organizations will help users find similar organizations or easily connect with actions when they’re in a new place. Affiliations will also determine notifications and access to restricted content.

### Showing networks of solidarity

Being able to assess relationships on our activist network will be an important way for people to inform their decisions.

* Do I want to join a certain action?
* Do I want to collaborate with a group on an event?
* Do I want to share my resources with someone?

You want to know who supports who and use this as a reference to decide if you want to join an event, group or organization? We want to make these networks of solidarity more visible.

#### **Strangers, supporters or allies?**

You can show support – for events, organizations and other individuals on the platform.

* **Supporter**: a one-way relationship of support
* **Ally**: a relationship of mutual support

#### T**rust effects access**

Affiliations determine notifications and degrees of access to restricted content.

Not every new supporter should know your most well-hidden secrets.
