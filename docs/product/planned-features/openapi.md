First off: central features of activist can be used without having a user profile!
{% endhint %}

Your activist profile(s) should serve only you and your organization.

Your housing activism bears little risk, but you have a different threat model for your climate activism? We got you. You will have the power to create multiple identities and have them verified for their authenticity by your peers.

#### **Your activist ID**

Use your activist IDs to sign into our partner platforms and tools.

#### Get verified

Members of organizations can verify skills of other members. Organizations can post requests for help and if they match with a user’s verified skills, they can receive a notification if they enable this.

#### On security

We need more people becoming politically active globally. But we need to do it as safe as possible while not creating huge barriers to participation.

There is no perfect security in a world increasingly on fire and at war – but we don’t want to put anyone in unnecessary danger.

The questions around identity / profiles are central to this and we aim to implement features, that have been extensively tested concerning their security. If you are an expert, we need your help. Please reach out to us.
