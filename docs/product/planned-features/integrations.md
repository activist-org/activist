# Tasks

Users will be able to attach kanban boards to every organization, group and event. This will allow those involved to easily plan and keep an overview of progress while templates guide organizers with best practices from our community.

### Getting done what is to be done

We hope to improve on our beloved pads. You want to know what is to be done? And who you can collaborate with? And where you can get help? Chatrooms simply are not great project management tools.

#### Kanban for activists

Agile development has changed how global teams collaborate on software – and we think activists can learn from this. Managing political projects is complex. A wide array of dependencies have to be handled in parallel with scarce resources and shifting priorities.

Who needs to to do what until when to ensure a successful campaign – or even simply a decent assembly?

#### See the work

Boards are giving you and your collaborators a visual representation of all the work packages, making it easier to understand the flow of tasks. To do, in progress, review, done.

This visual aspect helps teams quickly see the progress of each task, identify bottlenecks, and understand the overall workload.

#### Assign responsibilities

Organizations, groups and events will have dedicated boards that allow them to collaborate on their work – even across organizations and movements.

Tag users without sharing their email, phone number or other personal data and receive notifications if someone else needs your help.

#### Ask for help

There is a job that nobody in your organization can take care of?

Ping your supporters and if any of them have the necessary skill verified, they will receive a notification and will be linked up with you.

#### Keep an overview

Every organization, group and event can use a board to organize their tasks, but you don’t have to keep an eye out for all of the projects you are working on.

Every ticket you are tagged in will show up in your personal board, so you can quickly check-in what you still have to take care off – today.
