### Overview

The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section is a simple and powerful tool for organizations and groups on [activist.org](http://activist.org) to provide users with quick answers to common queries. This leads to less explaining of the same things over and over again.

### **Key functions**

* **For profiles and groups:** Both the organization profile as well as its group pages have their respective FAQ.
* **Easy to update**: New FAQ entries can easily be created and updated.
* **Coming soon**: With future updates to the feature, visitors will also be able to vote on the usefulness of answers and submit new questions directly via our platform.

### **How to use**

* **Access the different FAQ sections**: Simply navigate to the "_FAQ_” tab located in the menu of the respective organization or group. From there you will be directed to the specific FAQ.
* **Create new FAQ**: Click on the “_New FAQ_” button, add your question and add your answer to the question. Click save to finish the new entry.
* **Edit the FAQ:** Click on the pen next to the FAQ you want to edit and make your desired changes. Save the changes by clicking on the “Save” button.

### **Best practices**

* **Keep Questions Concise:** Ensure that questions are clear and concise to facilitate easy understanding for users.
* **Regular Updates:** Regularly review and update your FAQ section to address new questions you regularly receive.
* **Add an umbrella question:** Add a question that invites page visitors to reach out to you, if they do not find an answer to their question and explain how you want to be contacted in this case.
