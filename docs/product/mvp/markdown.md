### **Overview**

Profiles for organizations on [activist.org](http://activist.org) provide organizations of all sizes with customizable microsites. These profiles act as your organization's home on the platform, showcasing your work through an easy-to-use interface that supports a variety of modular features, including **Groups**, **FAQ** and **Resources** – and more functionality is planned.

### **Key functions**

* **Custom Microsites:** Organizations can use microsites with multiple subpages, allowing them to tailor their presence on [activist.org](http://activist.org) according to their needs. These microsites are equipped with a rich modular feature set, enabling you to showcase your work.
  * **About:** Share essential details about your mission, goals and objectives in your _About_ section, ensuring that your organization’s story is easily understandable to visitors.
  * **Image Slider:** Upload up to 10 images from your work or other visual explainer content into the slider of their profile.
  * **Get involved:** Explain the steps of how new people can get involved.
  * **Connect:** Where can people follow your organization or connect with you? Drop your channels and links here.
* **Groups:** Show the the structure of your organization, explain clearly how different parts of your organization interact and welcome new members efficiently to each group with tailored onboarding flows. Each group has their own About, FAQ and Resources. Learn more about **Groups** here.
* **Resources:** Keep all your public links in one easily accessible location. With future releases we will enable organizations to control the visibility of these resources, sharing them either with the public or exclusively with (certain) members. Learn more about **Resources** here.
* **FAQ:** Display and answer the questions you frequently get. You can answer them at the level of your organization or at the level of a group. Learn more about **FAQ** here.
* **Make sharing easy:** You and your organization can easily share your page both online and offline. Organizations have the ability to transform their pages into different file formats suitable for printing. This feature empowers organizations to create informative and visually appealing posters, complete with a QR code linking to their dynamic page on [activist.org](http://activist.org).

### **How to use**

2. **Customize Your Microsite:** Make changes according to your organization's needs and showcase your work.
3. **Visualize Your Structure:** Create Groups to illustrate your organization's structure and collaboration dynamics. This helps visitors understand how different components of your organization work together towards your common goal.
4. **Manage Resources:** Keep all your – for now only _public_ – links and resources organized within your profile. In future releases we will give you granular control over the visibility and access to resources, so you can also share links to internal documents with your members.
5. **Engage Your Audience:** Share your profile with your network and invite visitors to get to know your work. Get discovered and grow your membership.
