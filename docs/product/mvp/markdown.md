# Organization Profiles

Describe your organization’s aims and structure as well as answer frequently asked questions. Explain how your groups collaborate and safely onboard new people to the team.

### **Overview**

Profiles for organizations on [activist.org](http://activist.org) provide organizations of all sizes with customizable microsites. These profiles act as your organization's home on the platform, showcasing your work through an easy-to-use interface that supports a variety of modular features, including **Groups**, **FAQ** and **Resources** – and more functionality is planned.

### **Key functions**

* **Custom Microsites:** Organizations can use microsites with multiple subpages, allowing them to tailor their presence on [activist.org](http://activist.org) according to their needs. These microsites are equipped with a rich modular feature set, enabling you to showcase your work.
  * **About:** Share essential details about your mission, goals and objectives in your _About_ section, ensuring that your organization’s story is easily understandable to visitors.
  * **Image Slider:** Upload up to 10 images from your work or other visual explainer content into the slider of their profile.
  * **Get involved:** Explain the steps of how new people can get involved.
  * **Connect:** Where can people follow your organization or connect with you? Drop your channels and links here.
* **Groups:** Show the the structure of your organization, explain clearly how different parts of your organization interact and welcome new members efficiently to each group with tailored onboarding flows. Each group has their own About, FAQ and Resources. Learn more about **Groups** here.
* **Resources:** Keep all your public links in one easily accessible location. With future releases we will enable organizations to control the visibility of these resources, sharing them either with the public or exclusively with (certain) members. Learn more about **Resources** here.
* **FAQ:** Display and answer the questions you frequently get. You can answer them at the level of your organization or at the level of a group. Learn more about **FAQ** here.
* **Make sharing easy:** You and your organization can easily share your page both online and offline. Organizations have the ability to transform their pages into different file formats suitable for printing. This feature empowers organizations to create informative and visually appealing posters, complete with a QR code linking to their dynamic page on [activist.org](http://activist.org).

5. **Engage Your Audience:** Share your profile with your network and invite visitors to get to know your work. Get discovered and grow your membership.
