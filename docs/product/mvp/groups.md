# Groups

Groups within **Profiles** on [activist.org](http://activist.org) offer an easy as well as effective way for you to represent your organization’s structure and welcome new members efficiently to your group. By leveraging these subpages, you can generate interest for your work, streamline the onboarding process of new people and get more people quicker towards contributing to your cause.

### **Key functions**

* **Structured Representation:** Groups Subpages provide a structured overview of an organization's internal groups, including working groups, task forces, committees or any other collaborative entities. This structured representation allows members and visitors to understand the organization's functional units and how they contribute to the overarching mission.
* **Collaborative Environment:** These subpages serve as collaborative environments where groups can share Resources relevant to their specific focus areas. Just like Profiles, your Group pages have Resources.
* **Clear Communication:** Groups Subpages enable organizations to communicate the purpose, goals and activities of each group clearly. This clarity ensures that all members are aligned with the group's objectives and understand their roles and responsibilities within the organization. Just like Profiles, your Group pages have an FAQ.
* **Onboarding Support:** For new members joining an organization, Groups Subpages provide valuable onboarding support by offering insights into the organization's structure and the roles of various groups. This accelerates the integration of new members into the organization, enabling them to contribute faster and more effectively from the outset.

### **How to use**
