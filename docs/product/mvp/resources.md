# Resources

Organizations can keep important links (chats, articles, pads, etc.) in one place, group what belongs together and pin to the top what’s currently most important. Private by default, resources can also be made public to share information and best practices.

### **Overview**

**Resources** on [activist.org](http://activist.org) are designed to help organizations consolidate and manage their essential links in one hub. Whether it's chat rooms, articles, meeting notes, or other digital resources, this feature provides an intuitive way to organize and access various types of content easily.

### **Key functions**

Keep all your public links in one easily accessible location. With future releases we will enable organizations to control the visibility of these resources, sharing them either with the public or exclusively with (certain) members.

* **Links in the right place:** You can add resources both to your organization profile as well as your groups pages.
* **Public for now:** All links you add to your resources will be publicly visible – keep that in mind.
* **Soon – granular access management:** In future releases we will give you granular control over the visibility and access to resources, so you can also share links to internal documents with your members.
* **IMPORTANT – We do not offer file storage:** To ensure security and privacy, we do not provide cloud storage facilities for files. If your organization needs file storage solutions, our we are happy to help you find a great solution for your needs, prioritising open-source, secure and environmentally sustainable solutions.

### **How to use**

1. **Access the Resources**: Navigate to the **Resources** section of your organization or group.
2. **Add a new resource:** Click on the “New resource” button. Add a descriptive title, the URL and a short description which explains what the resource is about. Also add a location if the resource is specific to a given place (e.g. a city or a country). Create the new resource by clicking on “Create resource”.
3. **Share resource**: Click on the 3-dot menu next to the resource’s name and share the resource with whoever needs to see it.

### Best practices

* **Keep It Tidy**: Regularly update and organize your links to ensure that the most relevant resources are easy to find. Remove outdated links and reorganize sections as necessary.
* **Use Descriptive Titles**: When adding new links, use clear and descriptive titles to help users understand what the resource is about before they open the link.
* **Get creative with it**: You want to build an archive of articles that have disapeard of the internet? You want to cluster important maps for the climate movement? You want to build a library of action trainings that people can search on the platform? Reach out to us if you have ideas that you want to work on with us!
