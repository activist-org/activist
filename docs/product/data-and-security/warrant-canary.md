# Warrant canary

**Last Updated:** 02.11.2024\
**Status:** All clear as of the last update

#### What is a Warrant Canary?

A warrant canary is a regularly published statement confirming that we have not received any governmental demands (e.g., warrants or gag orders) that would compromise the security, privacy, or integrity of our users' data. If such a request were made, we would be legally unable to reveal it directly; however, the absence of this statement serves as an indirect signal that we have received such a request.

#### Our Hosting and Legal Jurisdictions

Our platform is hosted on servers in Iceland, a country with one of the world's strongest commitments to internet freedom and data privacy. However, our current legal representative is based in Germany, which subjects us to German and EU data regulations as well. We operate transparently to ensure that both Icelandic and German laws protect our usersâ€™ rights to the fullest extent possible.

#### Warrant Canary Statement

**As of 02.11.2024, we have not received any of the following:**

1. Warrants, National Security Letters, or court orders under Icelandic, German, or EU law demanding access to user data.
2. Requests under gag orders or similar provisions that prevent us from disclosing government requests for information.

Should any of these events occur, this statement will be removed from this page to notify our users of a change.

#### How Often We Update

We update this page monthly to ensure the most recent statement reflects any changes in our legal obligations or requests received.

#### Legal Limitations and Jurisdictional Notes

While Icelandic data privacy laws offer strong protections, our legal representative is based in Germany, subjecting us to certain requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other German legal frameworks. These may, in some cases, impose restrictions on our ability to notify users directly. However, this warrant canary reflects our commitment to data transparency and our pledge to defend user privacy to the fullest extent allowed.
