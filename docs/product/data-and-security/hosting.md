# Hosting

We are hosting our data in Iceland with a reputable hosting provider that is trusted by whistleblowers, activists and investigative journalists: [FlokiNET](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/blob/main).

Iceland is a strong supporter for net neutrality with strict privacy protection laws and freedom of the press. All these factors have contributed to making Iceland a preferred destination for data centers.
