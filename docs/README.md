# Intro to activist

[**activist.org**](https://activist.org/) is a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action. We want to enable activists to learn proven and novel strategies from each other for social and ecological change. Free, open-source, privacy-focused and governed by our community.

The activist community is creating a global platform where movements grow and people are inspired to join in political actions. We want to update how power is distributed in our society by removing barriers and enabling more people to safely engage in activism.
