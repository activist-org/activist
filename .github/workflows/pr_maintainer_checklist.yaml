            The activist team will do our best to address your contribution as soon as we can. If you're not already a member of our [public Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/#activist_community:matrix.org), please consider joining! We'd suggest that you use the [Element](https://element.io/) client as well as [Element X](https://element.io/app) for a mobile app, and definitely join the `General` and `Development` rooms once you're in. Also consider attending our [bi-weekly Saturday developer syncs](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/activist-dev-sync)! It'd be great to meet you üòä

            ## Maintainer Checklist

            The following is a checklist for maintainers to make sure this process goes as well as possible. Feel free to address the points below yourself in further commits if you realize that actions are needed :)

            - [ ] The TypeScript, pytest and formatting workflows within the [PR checks](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/checks) do not indicate new errors in the files changed

            - [ ] The Playwright end to end and Zap penetration tests have been ran and are passing (if necessary)

            - [ ] The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) has been updated with a description of the changes for the upcoming release and the corresponding issue (if necessary)

            ## First PR Commit Check

            - [ ] The commit messages for the remote branch of a new contributor should be checked to make sure their email is set up correctly so that they receive credit for their contribution
              - The contributor's name and icon in remote commits should be the same as what appears in the PR
              - If there's a mismatch, the contributor needs to make sure that the [email they use for GitHub](https://github.com/settings/emails) matches what they have for `git config user.email` in their local activist repo (can be set with `git config --global user.email "GITHUB_EMAIL"`)
